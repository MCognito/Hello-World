# Hello-World
My Introduction To GitHub

I am currently learning how to develop my abilities as a prgrammer.
I want to become a computer scientist so I'm taking the initiative and expanding my horizon of computers and technology itself.
I love computers and I find computers extremely interesting and fasinating.
